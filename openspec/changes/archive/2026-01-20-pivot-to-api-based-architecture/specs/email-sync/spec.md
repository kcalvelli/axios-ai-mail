# Email Sync Capability

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Declarative Account Configuration

The system SHALL support declarative account configuration via NixOS/Home Manager modules, maintaining the infrastructure-as-code approach.

#### Scenario: Define accounts in Nix

- **WHEN** a user configures accounts in their home.nix or NixOS configuration
- **THEN** the system SHALL generate the necessary runtime configuration files
- **AND** SHALL validate account configuration at build time (invalid provider, missing required fields)
- **AND** SHALL apply configuration changes on activation (home-manager switch)
- **AND** SHALL restart services if configuration changes require it

#### Scenario: Multiple account types

- **WHEN** a user configures different provider types (Gmail, IMAP, Outlook) in the same configuration
- **THEN** the system SHALL generate provider-specific configuration for each account
- **AND** SHALL support mixing OAuth2 and password-based authentication
- **AND** SHALL validate provider-specific options (e.g., IMAP requires host/port, Gmail requires OAuth)

#### Scenario: Configuration validation

- **WHEN** a user activates a configuration with invalid account settings
- **THEN** the Nix build SHALL fail with a clear error message indicating:
  - Which account has the error
  - What field is invalid or missing
  - Example of correct configuration
- **AND** SHALL NOT allow deployment of invalid configuration

#### Scenario: Idempotent configuration

- **WHEN** a user runs `home-manager switch` multiple times with the same configuration
- **THEN** the system SHALL produce identical results each time (idempotent)
- **AND** SHALL NOT create duplicate accounts or configurations
- **AND** SHALL only restart services if configuration actually changed

### Requirement: Provider Abstraction

The system SHALL provide a unified interface for interacting with different email providers (Gmail, IMAP, Outlook) to abstract provider-specific API differences.

#### Scenario: Gmail provider fetch

- **WHEN** the sync engine calls `fetch_messages()` on a Gmail provider
- **THEN** the provider SHALL use the Gmail API to retrieve messages
- **AND** SHALL return messages in a normalized `Message` format
- **AND** SHALL include message ID, subject, sender, recipients, date, snippet, and current labels

#### Scenario: IMAP provider fetch

- **WHEN** the sync engine calls `fetch_messages()` on an IMAP provider
- **THEN** the provider SHALL use IMAP protocol to retrieve messages
- **AND** SHALL detect available IMAP extensions (X-GM-LABELS, KEYWORD, METADATA)
- **AND** SHALL return messages in the same normalized `Message` format as other providers

#### Scenario: Provider label update

- **WHEN** the sync engine calls `update_labels(message_id, add_labels, remove_labels)`
- **THEN** the provider SHALL apply the specified label changes to the message
- **AND** SHALL handle provider-specific label formats (Gmail labels vs Outlook categories vs IMAP keywords)
- **AND** SHALL create labels that don't exist using provider-specific creation methods

### Requirement: Two-Way Synchronization

The system SHALL synchronize email metadata and labels bidirectionally between the local database and email providers.

#### Scenario: Fetch new messages

- **WHEN** a sync operation is triggered (timer or manual)
- **THEN** the system SHALL fetch messages newer than the last sync timestamp
- **AND** SHALL store message metadata in the local SQLite database
- **AND** SHALL queue unclassified messages for AI processing

#### Scenario: Push AI labels to provider

- **WHEN** a message is classified by the AI engine
- **THEN** the system SHALL map AI tags to provider-specific labels (e.g., `work` → `AI/Work` Gmail label)
- **AND** SHALL call the provider's `update_labels()` method to apply labels remotely
- **AND** SHALL record the label push in the database with timestamp

#### Scenario: Detect user label changes

- **WHEN** a user manually changes labels in their email client (Gmail web, Outlook mobile, etc.)
- **THEN** the next sync operation SHALL detect the label difference
- **AND** SHALL record the change as user feedback in the database
- **AND** SHALL NOT override user changes with AI classifications

#### Scenario: Incremental sync

- **WHEN** performing a sync operation on an account that was previously synced
- **THEN** the system SHALL use provider-specific incremental sync mechanisms:
  - Gmail: historyId to fetch only changes since last sync
  - Outlook: deltaLink for incremental queries
  - IMAP: UIDNEXT and CHANGEDSINCE extension if available
- **AND** SHALL fall back to timestamp-based filtering if incremental sync is unavailable

### Requirement: Multi-Account Support

#### Scenario: Parallel account sync

- **WHEN** a sync operation is triggered
- **THEN** the system SHALL sync all configured accounts
- **AND** SHALL run account syncs in parallel (using thread pool or async tasks)
- **AND** SHALL isolate errors per account (one account failure doesn't block others)

### Requirement: Secure Credential Storage

The system SHALL store OAuth tokens and IMAP passwords securely using encrypted storage mechanisms integrated with NixOS.

#### Scenario: sops-nix integration

- **AND** SHALL verify the file has restricted permissions (600)
- **AND** SHALL fail gracefully if the secret file is not accessible with a clear error message

#### Scenario: agenix integration

- **WHEN** a user configures an account with a credential file managed by agenix
- **THEN** the system SHALL read the age-encrypted secret from the agenix-provided path
- **AND** SHALL work transparently with agenix's decryption mechanism

#### Scenario: systemd-creds integration

- **WHEN** a user configures an account with `oauthTokenFile` pointing to `/run/credentials/axios-ai-mail.service/*`
- **THEN** the system SHALL read credentials loaded by systemd's LoadCredential mechanism
- **AND** SHALL only access credentials available to the service user

#### Scenario: Plain text password file (fallback)

- **WHEN** a user provides a plain text password file (not recommended, but supported)
- **THEN** the system SHALL read the file and warn in logs about security implications
- **AND** SHALL verify the file has restricted permissions (600)
- **AND** SHALL refuse to read world-readable credential files

#### Scenario: Invalid credential file

- **WHEN** a credential file path is configured but the file doesn't exist or isn't readable
