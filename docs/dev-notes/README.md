# Development Notes

This directory contains historical development session notes, phase completion reports, and implementation artifacts.

## Purpose

These files document the development journey and major milestones achieved during the project:

- **Phase Completion Reports** - Summaries of what was accomplished in each development phase
- **Session Summaries** - Notes from specific implementation sessions
- **Deployment Notes** - Records of successful deployments and configuration changes
- **Implementation Artifacts** - Technical notes and decisions made during development

## Organization

Files are kept here for historical reference but are not part of the active project documentation.

For current documentation, see:
- `/README.md` - Product overview and features
- `/QUICKSTART.md` - Getting started guide
- `/QUICKSTART_WEB.md` - Web UI specific quickstart
- `/openspec/` - Formal specifications and change proposals

## Note

These files are preserved for historical context but may become outdated as the project evolves.
